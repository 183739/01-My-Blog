Catch 'Em Like the Pros
Do you ever wonder how the elites of the BASS master classic catch so many fish year-round? Growing up, I remember catching a lot of fish in the early fall and spring, but none in the hot summers or cold winters. I didn't understand how I could catch hefty stringers in April but not even a cold in January. I recall flipping on the television one hot August night after a failed day of fishing to witness Chris Lane pull a six-pounder onto his boat. I assumed that these fishermen on the professional stage were just so good that they summoned their catches from whatever depths they were hiding in with their god-like fishing skills. Fortunately for all of us, that is not the case. With a little understanding of the driving force behind fish behavior and something known in the science world as *Limnology*, we too can catch fish in the most extreme of temperatures. 
	Limnology is the study of the biological, chemical, and physical features of lakes and other bodies of fresh water. A fish’s environment directly affects where it goes and how it behaves. As seasons change, so does the environment below the water’s surface. Temperature, sunlight, wind, and even barometric pressure are the keys to everything fish do on a given day of the year. 
	A mistake most fishermen make is overthinking a simple creature. As my personal favorite bass fishing professional Gerald Swindle puts it, a seven-pound bass does not discriminate experience, race, or age. The driving force behind a fish’s behavior is a combination of three things: survival, food, and reproduction. I will do my best to aid you in understanding these three simple things in my blog where I will cover Limnology basics and its affect on behavior, migration patterns through the seasons, the spawn, and feeding habits.
